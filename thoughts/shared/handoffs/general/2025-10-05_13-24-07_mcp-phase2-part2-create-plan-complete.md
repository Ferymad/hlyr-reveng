# Handoff: MCP Phase 2 Part 2 Complete + HumanLayer Adaptation Issues Discovered

## Task(s)

**‚úÖ COMPLETED:**
1. Updated all 3 `/create_plan` command variants with MCP integration
   - `.claude/commands/create_plan.md` - Main version (443 lines)
   - `.claude/commands/create_plan_generic.md` - Generic version (397 lines)
   - `.claude/commands/create_plan_nt.md` - No-thoughts version (387 lines)
2. Added mcp-package-researcher and codebase-dependency-tracer to initial research tasks
3. Added external-doc-researcher and MCP notes to Step 2 research section
4. Added MCP-Enhanced Verification to success criteria guidelines
5. Verified consistency across all 3 variants (48 lines added total, 16 per file)

**‚ö†Ô∏è DISCOVERED ISSUES:**
HumanLayer-specific references found in all 3 create_plan variants that need adaptation:
- Ticket pattern: "ENG-XXXX" vs Solo-Selman workspace "SOL-" prefix
- Path references: "thoughts/allison/" vs "thoughts/shared/"
- Directory references: "humanlayer-wui/" (doesn't exist in hlyr-reveng)
- Team member names: "allison" (not in Solo-Selman team)
- Potentially other humanlayer-specific patterns

**üìã NEXT SESSION TASKS:**
- **Option A**: Fix humanlayer ‚Üí hlyr-reveng adaptation issues in all create_plan variants
- **Option B**: Continue to Phase 2 Part 3 (`/implement_plan` command), then fix all adaptations together

**Git Status:**
- 3 files changed, 48 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
- Changes not yet committed

## Learnings

### 1. MCP Integration Pattern Consistency

All 3 variants received identical MCP enhancements:
- 2 new agents in initial research (mcp-package-researcher, codebase-dependency-tracer)
- Same 2 agents + external-doc-researcher in Step 2 research
- MCP auto-use notes in both locations
- Optional MCP-Enhanced Verification in success criteria

Verification confirmed:
- mcp-package-researcher: 6 occurrences (2 per file)
- codebase-dependency-tracer: 9 occurrences (3 per file)
- MCP-Enhanced Verification: 3 occurrences (1 per file)
- MCP auto-use notes: 6 occurrences (2 per file)

### 2. HumanLayer vs hlyr-reveng Differences

**Ticket Patterns:**
- HumanLayer: `ENG-XXXX` format (e.g., ENG-1478, ENG-2166)
- hlyr-reveng: `SOL-X` format (e.g., SOL-1 for first ticket)
- Found in: File naming patterns, ticket references, examples

**Path Structures:**
- HumanLayer: `thoughts/allison/tickets/`, `thoughts/allison/plans/`
- hlyr-reveng: `thoughts/shared/tickets/`, `thoughts/shared/plans/`
- create_plan.md uses "allison" paths in examples
- create_plan_nt.md correctly uses "shared" paths

**Directory References:**
- HumanLayer: `humanlayer-wui/`, `hld/` (daemon), multiple subprojects
- hlyr-reveng: No such directories - this is a meta-project for workflow development
- Found in: Agent spawn examples ("if WUI is mentioned, focus on humanlayer-wui/")

**Team Members:**
- HumanLayer: "allison" as team member in examples
- hlyr-reveng: Solo-Selman workspace, user is "Selman Ayan"

### 3. Phase 2 Part 2 Implementation Strategy

**What Changed:**
1. Initial research tasks section - added conditional agent spawning for external packages and dependencies
2. Step 2 research section - expanded agent types to include package research and external docs
3. Success criteria guidelines - added optional MCP enhancements note

**What Didn't Change:**
- Workflow structure (remains interactive and iterative)
- Core planning process (still Step 1-5)
- Success criteria format (automated vs manual separation)
- Plan template structure

**Graceful Degradation:**
- All MCP references are "if available" or "automatically use when available"
- No changes required if MCP unavailable
- Agents handle MCP presence/absence internally

### 4. User Workflow Preferences (from this session)

**Planning approach:**
- User requested "plan it out first gather required context before implementation"
- Used plan mode to research and present plan before execution
- User approved plan, then execution proceeded

**Quality standards:**
- User noticed humanlayer-specific patterns immediately
- Wants proper adaptation before moving to next phase
- Values thoroughness and correctness over speed

## Artifacts

**Files Modified (not yet committed):**
- `.claude/commands/create_plan.md:1-443` - Main create_plan command with MCP integration
- `.claude/commands/create_plan_generic.md:1-397` - Generic variant with MCP integration
- `.claude/commands/create_plan_nt.md:1-387` - No-thoughts variant with MCP integration

**Handoff Documents:**
- `thoughts/shared/handoffs/general/2025-10-05_13-24-07_mcp-phase2-part2-create-plan-complete.md` - This handoff

**Reference Documents:**
- `thoughts/shared/handoffs/general/2025-10-04_17-06-19_mcp-integration-strategy.md:991-1026` - Phase 2 Part 2 specification
- `thoughts/shared/handoffs/general/2025-10-04_17-06-19_mcp-integration-strategy.md:1029-1057` - Phase 2 Part 3 specification

## Action Items & Next Steps

### IMMEDIATE: Decide on Adaptation Strategy

**Option A: Fix Adaptations Before Phase 2 Part 3**
1. Search all 3 create_plan variants for humanlayer-specific patterns
2. Replace with hlyr-reveng equivalents:
   - ENG-XXXX ‚Üí SOL-X
   - thoughts/allison/ ‚Üí thoughts/shared/
   - humanlayer-wui/ references ‚Üí remove or genericize
   - "allison" ‚Üí remove or replace with "shared"
3. Verify no other humanlayer patterns remain
4. Commit fixes separately from MCP integration
5. Then proceed to Phase 2 Part 3

**Option B: Continue to Phase 2 Part 3, Fix Later**
1. Commit current MCP Phase 2 Part 2 changes
2. Implement Phase 2 Part 3 (`/implement_plan` command MCP integration)
3. Then fix all humanlayer adaptations across all affected commands in one pass
4. May find more adaptation issues in other commands

**Recommended: Option A** - Fix adaptations now while context is fresh, ensures create_plan commands work correctly before moving forward.

### NEXT: Phase 2 Part 3 Implementation

**After adaptations fixed:**
- Update `/implement_plan` command with MCP integration
- Reference: `thoughts/shared/handoffs/general/2025-10-04_17-06-19_mcp-integration-strategy.md:1029-1057`
- Add optional `review_diff` pre-commit review step
- Document when to use Kit MCP review vs manual review
- Estimated time: 30 minutes - 1 hour

### FUTURE: Additional Adaptation Work

**May need to check other commands for humanlayer patterns:**
- `/research_codebase` variants (already updated in Phase 2 Part 1, but verify)
- `/implement_plan` (before Phase 2 Part 3)
- `/commit` and `/describe_pr` commands
- Other slash commands in `.claude/commands/`

## Other Notes

### Specific Patterns to Search For

**In all create_plan variants:**
- `ENG-` (ticket prefix pattern)
- `thoughts/allison/` (path pattern)
- `humanlayer-wui` (directory reference)
- `allison` (team member name)
- `hld/` (daemon directory - may be legitimate in some contexts)

**Example locations found:**
- `.claude/commands/create_plan.md:25-26` - File path examples with "thoughts/allison/"
- `.claude/commands/create_plan.md:56` - Directory focus example mentions "humanlayer-wui/"
- `.claude/commands/create_plan.md:167-174` - Plan naming format with "ENG-XXXX"
- `.claude/commands/create_plan.md:267` - Ticket reference example

### MCP Phase 2 Overall Progress

**‚úÖ Completed:**
- Phase 1: Agent enhancements (4 agents: codebase-locator, codebase-analyzer, codebase-pattern-finder, mcp-package-researcher)
- Phase 2 Part 1: `/research_codebase` command integration (3 variants)
- Linear Agents: linear-ticket-reader, linear-searcher created
- Phase 2 Part 2: `/create_plan` command integration (3 variants) ‚Üê **WE ARE HERE**

**‚è≥ Remaining:**
- Phase 2 Part 3: `/implement_plan` command integration
- HumanLayer ‚Üí hlyr-reveng adaptation (discovered issue)
- Additional command adaptations (TBD)

### File Locations Quick Reference

**Modified Commands:**
- `.claude/commands/create_plan.md` - Main planning command
- `.claude/commands/create_plan_generic.md` - Generic planning variant
- `.claude/commands/create_plan_nt.md` - No-thoughts planning variant

**MCP Documentation:**
- `CLAUDE.md` - MCP integration guidelines (updated in Phase 1 and Linear agents)
- `.claude/agents/mcp-package-researcher.md` - Package research agent
- `.claude/agents/codebase-dependency-tracer.md` - Dependency tracing agent
- `.claude/agents/external-doc-researcher.md` - External documentation agent

**Integration Strategy:**
- `thoughts/shared/handoffs/general/2025-10-04_17-06-19_mcp-integration-strategy.md` - Complete 12-part MCP blueprint

### Git Commit Strategy

**Current uncommitted changes:**
- 48 lines added across 3 files (MCP Phase 2 Part 2)

**Recommended commit sequence:**
1. Commit MCP Phase 2 Part 2 changes first: `feat: integrate MCP into /create_plan command (Phase 2 Part 2)`
2. Then commit adaptation fixes separately: `fix: adapt create_plan commands from humanlayer to hlyr-reveng patterns`
3. Alternatively: Fix adaptations first, then commit both together

**Git message template (for MCP commit):**
```
feat: integrate MCP into /create_plan command (Phase 2 Part 2)

Updates all 3 create_plan variants with MCP-enhanced agents:
- Add mcp-package-researcher for external package integration
- Add codebase-dependency-tracer for dependency analysis
- Add external-doc-researcher for documentation research
- Add optional MCP-Enhanced Verification to success criteria

All agents automatically use Kit MCP (codebase intelligence) and
Ref MCP (documentation research) when available. Graceful
degradation if MCP unavailable.
