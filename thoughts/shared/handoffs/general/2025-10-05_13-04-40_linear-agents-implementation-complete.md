# Handoff: Linear Agents Implementation Complete

## Task(s)

**âœ… COMPLETED:**
1. Investigated humanlayer repository's Linear integration patterns (discovered agents don't exist there either)
2. Analyzed this repo's documented Linear workflow vs actual Linear workspace configuration
3. Fixed critical configuration mismatch in `.claude/commands/linear.md`:
   - Updated from humanlayer's 14-state workflow to this repo's 6-state workflow
   - Replaced humanlayer team/user/state/label IDs with Solo-Selman workspace IDs
   - Updated thoughts URL to `https://github.com/Ferymad/thoughts`
4. Created two Linear agents following established agent patterns:
   - `linear-ticket-reader` - Read ticket details with comments
   - `linear-searcher` - Search tickets by query/status/labels/dates
5. Tested both agents successfully with Linear MCP tools
6. Updated `CLAUDE.md` with Linear MCP integration guidance
7. Created Linear ticket SOL-1 documenting tree command token overflow issue

**ðŸ“‹ NEXT SESSION TASKS:**
- Continue MCP Phase 2 Part 2: Update `/create_plan` command with MCP integration
- Continue MCP Phase 2 Part 3: Update `/implement_plan` command with MCP integration

- `.claude/commands/linear.md:47-68` - Updated thoughts URL and default project/labels
- `.claude/commands/linear.md:287-294` - Updated state transition suggestions
- `.claude/commands/linear.md:336-359` - Replaced humanlayer IDs with Solo-Selman IDs
- `CLAUDE.md:3` - Added Linear MCP to project description
- `CLAUDE.md:42-54` - Added "For Linear Ticket Management" section
- `CLAUDE.md:76-82` - Added linear-ticket-reader and linear-searcher to agent usage guide

## Learnings

### 1. Linear Agents Don't Exist in Humanlayer Either

**Critical Discovery:**
- Both `linear-ticket-reader` and `linear-searcher` are **referenced** in humanlayer's command files
- But these agents **never existed** in `.claude/agents/` directory (not in humanlayer, not anywhere)
- Commands were written expecting these agents but agents were never implemented
- This repo now has working Linear agents that humanlayer doesn't have

### 2. Agent Pattern Requirements (From Pattern Analysis)

**All agents MUST have in frontmatter:**
- `name`: Kebab-case matching filename
- `description`: Multi-line with 3 XML `<example>` blocks showing when to invoke
- `tools`: Comma-separated list
- `model`: `sonnet` or `inherit`
- `color`: Visual identifier (optional but recommended)

**All agents MUST have in body:**
- "Initial Setup" section with MCP availability check
- "CRITICAL: YOUR ONLY JOB IS TO..." section with DO NOT/ONLY constraints
- "Core Responsibilities" numbered list (3-5 items)
- Strategy section with step-by-step workflow
- "Output Format" with template showing "Search Method Used" subsection FIRST
- "What NOT to Do" bullet list
- "REMEMBER: You are a documentarian..." closing block

**First attempt at Linear agents was missing:**
- All frontmatter fields except `tools`
- MCP availability checks
- XML invocation examples
- Graceful degradation documentation
- Proper "CRITICAL" section formatting

### 3. Linear Configuration Was Completely Wrong

**Original state:**
- `.claude/commands/linear.md` had humanlayer's team ID, user IDs, state IDs, label IDs
- Referenced 14-state workflow (Triage â†’ Spec Needed â†’ Research Needed â†’ ... â†’ Done)
- Thoughts URLs pointed to `https://github.com/humanlayer/thoughts`
- Would not work with Solo-Selman Linear workspace at all

**Actual workspace:**
- Team: Solo-Selman (ID: `2f08b976-825c-44e3-a5e6-c8221cd1440d`)
- 6-state workflow: Triage â†’ Research â†’ Planning â†’ In Dev â†’ In Review â†’ Done
- Project: Context101 (ID: `169e5e68-e19e-4811-85aa-d5324490d75e`)
- Labels: Bug, Feature, Improvement (not hld/wui/meta)
- User: Selman Ayan (ID: `2b2688ae-4241-4d5d-bce0-12c8df398366`)

### 4. Tree Command Token Overflow Issue

**Problem documented in SOL-1:**
- `mcp__kit-dev__get_file_tree` fails on humanlayer repo (7.9GB, 98k files)
- Tool returns 4.4M tokens (175x over 25k limit)
- Tool doesn't respect `.gitignore` (includes all node_modules)
- Git tracks only 670 files but tool returns all 98,895 files

**Current workarounds:**
- Use targeted `Glob` searches
- Use `Grep` to find specific files
- Use `ls` with specific paths
- Cannot get full repository structure overview

### 5. User Workflow Preferences

**Decision-making style:**
- User makes critical decisions (workflows, agent scope, priorities)
- User chose: 6-state workflow + minimal 2 agents + read-write capability
- User configured Linear workspace states before agent creation
- User provides own thoughts repository URL

**"Ultrathink" pattern:**
- User expects detailed analysis with decision points before execution
- User reviews options with recommendations and rationale
- User corrects approach in real-time (e.g., agent pattern analysis request)

### Agent Pattern Template (For Future Reference)

Established pattern from codebase analysis (6 agents analyzed):
- Frontmatter: name, description (multi-line with 3 XML examples), tools, model, color
- Initial Setup: MCP availability check with 2 options (available/unavailable)
- CRITICAL section: ALL CAPS header with DO NOT/ONLY bullet list
- Core Responsibilities: Numbered list (3-5 items) with bold headers
- Strategy: Step-by-step workflow with tool usage examples
- Output Format: Template with "Search Method Used" subsection FIRST
- What NOT to Do: Bullet list of prohibitions
- REMEMBER: Closing paragraph reinforcing documentarian role

### MCP Tools Available

**Linear MCP (Full Suite):**
- `mcp__linear-server__get_issue` - Get ticket details
- `mcp__linear-server__list_issues` - Search tickets
- `mcp__linear-server__list_comments` - Get ticket comments
- `mcp__linear-server__update_issue` - Update ticket fields
- `mcp__linear-server__create_comment` - Add comment to ticket
- `mcp__linear-server__list_teams`, `list_projects`, `list_issue_statuses`, `list_issue_labels` - Metadata

**Kit MCP (Codebase Intelligence):**
- All tools from Phase 1 (open_repository, extract_symbols, find_symbol_usages, etc.)
- **Known issue**: `get_file_tree` fails on large repos (see SOL-1)

**Ref MCP (Documentation):**
- All tools from Phase 1 (ref_search_documentation, ref_read_url)
- Occasional 502 errors observed but generally reliable

### Testing Results

**linear-ticket-reader agent:**
- âœ… Successfully read SOL-1 ticket with full details
- âœ… Retrieved description, status, priority, metadata, git branch
- âœ… Included "Search Method Used" section
- âœ… Maintained documentarian role (no critiques)

**linear-searcher agent:**
- âœ… Successfully searched for "MCP" and "Kit" keywords
- âœ… Found 1 ticket (SOL-1) in both searches
- âœ… Grouped results by status (Triage, Research, Planning, etc.)
- âœ… Included "Search Method Used" section
- âœ… Maintained documentarian role (no recommendations)

**Linear Workflow:**
- `thoughts/shared/docs/linear-workspace-setup-guide.md` - 6-state workflow design and setup instructions

### Session Success Pattern

**What worked well:**
1. User requested pattern analysis before accepting Linear agents
2. Subagents identified all missing requirements (frontmatter, XML examples, MCP checks)
3. Complete agent rewrite following established conventions
4. Testing both agents before moving to next step
5. Comprehensive commit message documenting all changes

**Key insight:** User values thoroughness and wants agents to match existing patterns precisely. When user says "check whether they're written well," this means "analyze against existing agents and ensure full compliance."
