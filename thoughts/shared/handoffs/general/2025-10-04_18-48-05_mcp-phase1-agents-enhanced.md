# Handoff: MCP Phase 1 - Three Agents Enhanced with Kit MCP Tools

## Task(s)

**COMPLETED (Phase 1 - Agents 1-3 of 6):**
1. ✅ Enhanced `codebase-locator` agent with 4 Kit MCP tools
2. ✅ Enhanced `codebase-analyzer` agent with 5 Kit MCP tools
3. ✅ Enhanced `codebase-pattern-finder` agent with 3 Kit MCP tools (grep_ast removed after testing)
4. ✅ Tested all agents on real HumanLayer Go/TypeScript codebase
5. ✅ Investigated grep_ast tool effectiveness (all 3 modes: simple, pattern, query)
6. ✅ Validated agent intelligence and tool selection behavior
7. ✅ Documented tool effectiveness and limitations

**IN PROGRESS:**
- Agent definitions updated and uncommitted

**PENDING (Phase 1 - Remaining 3 Agents):**
1. Rename and enhance `web-search-researcher` → `external-doc-researcher` (add Ref MCP)
2. Skip `thoughts-locator` (no changes needed per strategy)
3. Skip `thoughts-analyzer` (no changes needed per strategy)
4. Update `CLAUDE.md` with MCP integration guidelines
5. Commit all changes with descriptive commit message

## Learnings

### 1. grep_ast Tool Investigation (CRITICAL)

**Tested all 3 modes on Go and TypeScript code:**
- **simple mode**: Searches literal text in AST nodes, returns container nodes (source_file, package, import) - ❌ NOT useful
- **pattern mode**: Tested "var_declaration", "type_declaration", "method_declaration", "function" - returns empty or containers - ❌ NOT functional
- **query mode**: Tested tree-sitter syntax "(method_declaration) @method" - returns empty - ❌ NOT functional

**Conclusion:** grep_ast is NOT suitable for pattern finding. Traditional Grep with regex is far more effective.

**Evidence:**
- Test 1: `grep_ast(pattern="errors.New", mode="simple")` → returned package/import nodes, not error declarations
- Test 2: `grep_ast(pattern="async function", mode="simple")` → returned import statements, not async functions
- Test 3: Multiple pattern/query mode tests → all returned empty results

### 2. extract_symbols Tool - Highly Effective

**Works excellently for:**
- Getting symbol inventory (functions, classes, methods, variables)
- Comparing API signatures across files
- Understanding structure without reading files
- **Cached** - subsequent calls are instant

**Example:** `extract_symbols(file="hld/store/errors.go")` returned 6 symbols (2 structs, 4 methods) with line ranges and code snippets.

**Best for:** API comparison tasks, NOT construction pattern finding

### 3. find_symbol_usages - Use with Caution

**Returns ALL symbols with matching name across:**
- ✅ Target codebase (Go files)
- ❌ JavaScript dependencies (node_modules)
- ❌ Python dependencies (test_env)
- ❌ Completely unrelated codebases in repo

**Example:** `find_symbol_usages(symbol="NotFoundError")` returned 50+ results including Python's FileNotFoundError, JavaScript's NotFoundError in rxjs, etc.

**Best for:** Unique, project-specific symbol names. NOT common terms like "Error", "Handler", "Config".

### 4. Agent Behavior Validation

**The codebase-pattern-finder agent behaved INTELLIGENTLY:**
- Attempted grep_ast as instructed
- Recognized it returned "AST tokens rather than code patterns"
- Chose Grep as more effective alternative
- Explained decision transparently in output
- Completed task successfully (found 7 error patterns)

**Verdict:** Agent was smarter than our initial design. It prioritized RESULTS over COMPLIANCE.

### 5. Tool Selection Patterns

**For codebase-locator:**
- `get_file_tree` → understanding directory structure (can return massive output, use on subdirectories)
- `extract_symbols` → getting symbol inventory without reading files
- `grep_ast` → NOT useful for finding code (tested and confirmed)

**For codebase-analyzer:**
- `extract_symbols` → quick API overview before deep reading
- `find_symbol_usages` → trace function calls (good for unique names)
- `get_dependency_graph` → understand module relationships
- Read tool still primary for implementation details

**For codebase-pattern-finder:**
- Grep → PRIMARY tool for all pattern finding (construction, usage, naming)
- `extract_symbols` → OPTIONAL for API signature comparison only
- `find_symbol_usages` → OPTIONAL for unique symbol tracing (with caution)

### 6. API Comparison Section Design Issue

**Original design:** Add API comparison to all pattern-finding output

**Problem:** API comparison is for FUNCTION SIGNATURE comparison (sync vs async handlers), not all patterns

**Fix:** Made section OPTIONAL with clear criteria:
- ✅ Include when: comparing function APIs, handler signatures, validation function structures
- ❌ Skip when: finding construction patterns (how to build), usage patterns (how to use)

## Artifacts

**Agent Definition Files (Modified):**
- `.claude/agents/codebase-locator.md` - Enhanced, tested, working
- `.claude/agents/codebase-analyzer.md` - Enhanced, tested, working
- `.claude/agents/codebase-pattern-finder.md` - Enhanced, tested, working (grep_ast removed)

**Strategy Documents (Referenced):**
- `thoughts/shared/handoffs/general/2025-10-04_17-06-19_mcp-integration-strategy.md:415-720` - Primary specification
- `thoughts/shared/handoffs/general/2025-10-04_17-59-42_codebase-locator-mcp-enhancement.md` - Previous handoff

**Test Results (In Session Context):**
- codebase-analyzer test: analyzed `hld/daemon/daemon.go` successfully
- codebase-pattern-finder test: found 7 Go error patterns successfully
- grep_ast investigation: tested on Go and TypeScript files, confirmed ineffective

## Action Items & Next Steps

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Commit Current Work:**
   ```bash
   git add .claude/agents/codebase-*.md
   git commit -m "feat: enhance codebase agents with Kit MCP tools

   - Add Kit MCP tools to codebase-locator (4 tools)
   - Add Kit MCP tools to codebase-analyzer (5 tools)
   - Add Kit MCP tools to codebase-pattern-finder (3 tools)
   - Remove grep_ast from pattern-finder (tested ineffective)
   - Add tool usage guidance and warnings
   - Make API comparison optional with clear criteria

   Tested on HumanLayer Go/TypeScript codebase, validated agent
   intelligence and tool effectiveness."
   ```

2. **Continue with web-search-researcher Enhancement:**
   - Read strategy document lines 612-720
   - This involves Ref MCP (different from Kit MCP)
   - Rename agent to `external-doc-researcher`
   - Add `mcp__Ref__ref_search_documentation` and `mcp__Ref__ref_read_url`
   - Update research process to prioritize Ref MCP over WebSearch

3. **Skip thoughts-* Agents:**
   - Strategy document confirms NO CHANGES needed (lines 724-732)
   - thoughts-locator: operates on local filesystem, Grep/Glob/LS optimal
   - thoughts-analyzer: analyzes markdown, Read tool sufficient

4. **Update CLAUDE.md:**
   - Follow specification at lines 1082-1158 of strategy document
   - Add MCP integration guidelines
   - Document when to use Kit MCP vs traditional tools

### Testing Recommendations

When resuming:
1. Initialize Kit MCP repo: `mcp__kit-dev__open_repository("/home/selman/dev/humanlayer")`
2. Test each agent after enhancement
3. Verify tool reporting works (agents report which tools they used)
4. Verify graceful degradation (agents fall back when tools unavailable)

## Other Notes

### Repository Context

**HumanLayer repository initialized as `repo_0`** in Kit MCP. To resume testing:
```python
mcp__kit-dev__open_repository("/home/selman/dev/humanlayer")
# Returns: repo_0
```

### Context Usage Pattern

- Started at 44k tokens (after /resume_handoff)
- Ended at 93k tokens (49k used)
- grep_ast investigation consumed ~15k tokens
- Heavy testing and tool validation consumed most context

### Tool Availability Check

All MCP tools verified available:
- Kit MCP: ✅ (grep_ast, extract_symbols, find_symbol_usages, get_file_tree, get_dependency_graph, open_repository)
- Ref MCP: ✅ (ref_search_documentation, ref_read_url)
- Linear MCP: ✅ (various Linear tools)

### Files NOT Modified Yet

- `CLAUDE.md` - needs MCP guidelines per strategy lines 1082-1158
- `web-search-researcher.md` - needs rename and Ref MCP integration
- Any handoff documents - this is the first handoff from this session

### Phase 1 Progress

**Overall Phase 1:** 50% complete (3 of 6 agents)
- ✅ codebase-locator
- ✅ codebase-analyzer
- ✅ codebase-pattern-finder
- 🔄 web-search-researcher (renamed, Ref MCP needed)
- ⏭️ thoughts-locator (skip - no changes)
- ⏭️ thoughts-analyzer (skip - no changes)

**Effective completion:** 75% (3 of 4 agents requiring changes)
