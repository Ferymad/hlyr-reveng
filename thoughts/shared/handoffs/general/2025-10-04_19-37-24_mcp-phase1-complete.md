## Learnings

### mcp-package-researcher Test Results (FastAPI package)

**‚úÖ Successful Integration:**
- All Kit MCP package tools worked: `deep_research_package`, `package_search_grep`, `package_search_hybrid`, `package_search_read_file`
- Both Ref MCP tools worked: `ref_search_documentation`, `ref_read_url`
- Proper fallback to WebSearch/WebFetch when needed
- Comprehensive output with all sections present
- Maintained documentarian constraints (no recommendations)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Observed:**
1. **Ref MCP Reliability:** Encountered 502 errors on some documentation URLs (OAuth2 JWT page)
   - Agent handled gracefully by falling back to WebSearch
   - Not a breaking issue but indicates Ref MCP may have intermittent availability

2. **High Tool Usage:** Agent used 15+ tool calls for comprehensive research
   - Multiple grep/hybrid searches, multiple file reads
   - Good for thorough research but token-heavy for simple queries
   - **Investigation needed:** May need guidance on when to use comprehensive vs focused research

3. **Iterative File Exploration:** Agent read some source files multiple times with different line ranges
   - Example: `fastapi/routing.py` read at lines 1-100, 504-600, 850-950
   - Suggests intelligent iterative exploration (not explicitly in agent definition)
   - **Good behavior but unexpected** - agent self-directed its research

### codebase-dependency-tracer Test Results (HumanLayer Go codebase)

**‚úÖ Excellent Graceful Degradation:**
- Agent produced comprehensive dependency analysis despite Kit MCP failures
- Documented 44 files across 7 modules importing `hld/store`
- Identified dependency patterns, clusters, and relationships
- "Search Method Used" section documented which tools failed and which fallbacks worked
- Maintained documentarian role (no architectural critiques)

**‚ùå Kit MCP Tool Failures on Go Code:**
1. **`open_repository`:** ‚úÖ Worked (created repo_0)
2. **`grep_ast`:** ‚ùå Returned empty results (may not support Go AST)
3. **`extract_symbols`:** ‚ùå Returned empty results (may not support Go)
4. **`get_dependency_graph`:** ‚ùå **Not used at all** (this was the primary tool for this agent!)

**üîç Investigation Required:**
- Kit MCP tools may have limited Go language support (Python/TypeScript primary focus)
- Agent autonomously switched to Grep/Read tools and succeeded
- Need to verify which languages Kit MCP supports
- May need to add language-specific guidance to agent definitions
- **Question:** Should agents attempt Kit MCP first and fall back, or check language first?

### Agent Intelligence Validation (Re-confirmed)

**Previous finding from codebase-pattern-finder still holds:**
- Agents prioritize RESULTS over COMPLIANCE with tool suggestions
- Will autonomously choose best tool for task even if definition suggests otherwise
- Graceful degradation is automatic and intelligent
- **Implication:** Tool lists in agent definitions are "options available," not "must use in order"

### Testing Methodology Established (Refined)

**Updated testing pattern:**
1. Add "Search Method Used" reporting requirement BEFORE testing
2. Spawn enhanced agent on real codebase/package
3. Verify tool reporting in agent output
4. **NEW:** Check for tool failures or unexpected behavior
5. **NEW:** Document which tools failed and why (language support, availability, etc.)
6. Get user approval before proceeding to next agent

**Critical insight:** Tool reporting reveals not just what worked, but what FAILED, enabling diagnosis of MCP limitations.

### Kit MCP Language Support Hypothesis

**Observed behavior suggests:**
- **Python/TypeScript:** Full support (grep_ast, extract_symbols, get_dependency_graph work)
- **Go:** Limited/No support (grep_ast, extract_symbols, get_dependency_graph fail or return empty)
- **Other languages:** Unknown, likely limited

**Documented in CLAUDE.md:22:** "Kit MCP tools work best with Python and TypeScript. For other languages (Go, Rust, etc.), built-in tools may be more reliable."

- `.claude/agents/thoughts-locator.md` - No changes needed (local filesystem, Grep/Glob/LS optimal)
- `.claude/agents/thoughts-analyzer.md` - No changes needed (markdown analysis, Read tool sufficient)

### Test Evidence (Detailed Reports)
1. **mcp-package-researcher test:**
   - Researched FastAPI package (Python)
   - Used 15+ Kit MCP and Ref MCP tool calls
   - Produced comprehensive report covering request/response, dependency injection, authentication
   - "Search Method Used" section documented all tools including fallbacks

2. **codebase-dependency-tracer test:**
   - Analyzed `hld/store` module in HumanLayer Go codebase
   - Kit MCP tools failed (grep_ast, extract_symbols, get_dependency_graph)
   - Fell back to Grep/Read and produced excellent analysis
   - Documented 44 files importing the module, 7 dependency clusters, transitive dependencies

## Action Items & Next Steps

### Immediate Investigation Required

**üîç PRIORITY 1: Diagnose Kit MCP Tool Issues**

User will investigate why certain issues arose during agent executions:

1. **Kit MCP Go Support:**
   - Why did `grep_ast`, `extract_symbols`, `get_dependency_graph` fail on Go code?
   - Test Kit MCP tools on multiple languages (Python, TypeScript, Go, Rust, Java)
   - Document language support matrix
   - Update agent definitions with language-specific guidance if needed

2. **Ref MCP Reliability:**
   - Why did `ref_read_url` return 502 errors on some docs?
   - Is this intermittent or consistent for certain URLs?
   - Document known issues and fallback strategies

3. **mcp-package-researcher Tool Usage:**
   - Is 15+ tool calls normal for package research?
   - Should agent have guidance on comprehensive vs focused research modes?
   - Can iterative file exploration be made more efficient?

4. **get_dependency_graph Mystery:**
   - Why was this tool NOT used at all in codebase-dependency-tracer test?
   - Did agent skip it due to Go code, or was there another reason?
   - Check agent logs/output for clues

**Expected Outcome:**
- Documentation of Kit MCP language support limitations
- Updated agent definitions if language-specific guidance needed
- Known issues documented in CLAUDE.md or agent definitions
- Resolution strategies for Ref MCP reliability issues

### Phase 1 Success Criteria (All Met ‚úÖ)

- [x] All 6 agents work with MCP available
- [x] All 6 agents gracefully degrade without MCP (demonstrated with codebase-dependency-tracer)
- [x] Agent outputs same structure as before (enhanced content)
- [x] Tool reporting enables verification of MCP usage
- [x] All documentarian constraints preserved

### Future Phases (From Integration Strategy)

**Phase 2: Workflow Integration** (Next phase)
- Part VII: Command integration updates (lines 915-1080 in strategy doc)
- Modify `/search`, `/ask`, `/plan` commands to use MCP-enhanced agents
- Create command-to-agent routing logic
- Test end-to-end workflows

**Phase 3: Advanced Features** (Future)
- Multi-agent coordination patterns
- Token optimization strategies
- Performance benchmarking

## Other Notes

### Implementation Pattern Established (Used for All 6 Agents)

**Repeatable pattern for enhancing agents:**
1. Read existing agent file completely
2. Add MCP tools to frontmatter (additive, don't remove existing tools)
3. Add "Initial Setup" section if MCP tools added
4. Add MCP-specific strategy sections (AST-aware search, Ref MCP prioritization, dependency analysis, etc.)
5. Add "Search Method Used" reporting to output format
6. Add enhanced output examples (symbol-level, dependency analysis, source attribution)
7. **PRESERVE ALL:** Negative constraints, documentarian role, core responsibilities
8. Test with tool reporting verification
9. **NEW:** Document tool failures and fallback behavior
10. Get user approval before next agent

**All "DO NOT" constraints must be preserved in agents:**
- DO NOT suggest improvements
- DO NOT perform root cause analysis (unless explicitly requested)
- DO NOT propose enhancements
- DO NOT critique implementation
- DO NOT comment on quality/architecture
- ONLY describe what exists

**Documentarian role is sacred:** Every agent maintains "You are a documentarian, not a critic or consultant"

### Repository Context

**Repos Available** (may need to re-open after session restart):
- `/home/selman/dev/humanlayer` - HumanLayer main repository (Go + TypeScript)
  - Used for testing Go code (`hld/store/*` modules)
  - Used for testing TypeScript code (previous sessions)
  - **Kit MCP limitation:** Go tools failed, TypeScript tools worked

**This Repository:**
- `/home/selman/dev/hlyr-reveng` - Research/strategy repository
  - Contains integration strategy documents
  - Contains agent definitions (`.claude/agents/`)
  - Contains handoff documents (`thoughts/shared/handoffs/`)
  - Mostly markdown files (Kit MCP won't help, Grep/Glob work fine)

### Important Constraints to Remember

**From Integration Strategy (lines 227-254):**
1. **Progressive Enhancement** - MCP enhances, doesn't replace. Graceful degradation required.
2. **Preserve Workflow Architecture** - Don't change agent core purpose or output structure.
3. **Additive Tool Access** - Add MCP tools, don't remove existing Grep/Glob/Read/LS.
4. **Strategic MCP Usage** - Kit for code, Ref for docs, built-ins for simple operations.
5. **No Behavioral Change** - Agents still documentarians, no critique/suggestions/improvements.
