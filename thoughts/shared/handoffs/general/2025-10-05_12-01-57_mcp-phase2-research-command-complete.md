# Handoff: MCP Phase 2 Part 1 - /research_codebase Command Integration Complete

## Task(s)

**âœ… COMPLETED (Phase 2 Part 1):**
1. Acquired `hack/spec_metadata.sh` from humanlayer repo for metadata generation
2. Integrated MCP into all 3 `/research_codebase` command variants
3. Added automatic Kit MCP initialization when available
4. Updated agent references (web-search-researcher â†’ external-doc-researcher)
5. Added new MCP agents (mcp-package-researcher, codebase-dependency-tracer)
6. Added CRITICAL instruction for external doc agents to return links
7. Verified graceful degradation (all changes work with/without MCP)
8. Created 2 commits documenting all changes

**ðŸ“‹ NEXT SESSION TASKS:**
- **Primary Goal**: Create Linear agents adapted from humanlayer repo
- **Critical Setup**: Open 2 repositories (hlyr-reveng + humanlayer)
- **Investigation Required**: Deep dive into Linear agents in humanlayer
- **Adaptation Required**: Adapt Linear agents for this repo's specific use case and vision
- **Known Issue**: Tree command will error due to token overflow - needs investigation

**Reference Strategy:**
- Integration strategy: `thoughts/shared/handoffs/general/2025-10-04_17-06-19_mcp-integration-strategy.md:915-1080`
- Phase 1 completion: `thoughts/shared/handoffs/general/2025-10-04_19-37-24_mcp-phase1-complete.md`

## Critical References

1. **Integration Strategy** - `thoughts/shared/handoffs/general/2025-10-04_17-06-19_mcp-integration-strategy.md:915-1080`
   - Phase 2 Part 1 specification (lines 921-988)
   - Phase 2 Part 2 specification (lines 991-1026) - `/create_plan` command next
   - Phase 2 Part 3 specification (lines 1029-1057) - `/implement_plan` command

2. **User Decisions Documented:**
   - Update all 3 command versions (not just main)
   - Keep Linear agent references (will create agents in next session)
   - Auto-initialize Kit MCP when available (not optional)
   - Moderate agent guidance (Option B - not minimal, not comprehensive)
   - Keep current metadata script approach (mixed across versions)

3. **CLAUDE.md** - `CLAUDE.md:1-97`
   - Tool selection decision tree (already up-to-date)
   - All 8 agents documented (6 MCP + 2 thoughts)
   - Graceful degradation explanation

## Recent Changes

**Commit 1 (e42bda8):** feat: add hack/spec_metadata.sh and MCP example config
- `hack/spec_metadata.sh:1-36` - NEW: Metadata generation script from humanlayer
- `.mcp.example.json:1-16` - NEW: Team-shared MCP template
- `.mcp.json` - DELETED: Moved to example

**Commit 2 (6bcf887):** feat: integrate MCP into /research_codebase command (Phase 2 Part 1)
- `.claude/commands/research_codebase.md:14-30` - Added MCP auto-initialization
- `.claude/commands/research_codebase.md:51-70` - Updated agent spawning with new agents
- `.claude/commands/research_codebase_generic.md:5-21` - Added MCP auto-initialization
- `.claude/commands/research_codebase_generic.md:38-60` - Updated agent spawning with new agents
- `.claude/commands/research_codebase_nt.md:14-30` - Added MCP auto-initialization
- `.claude/commands/research_codebase_nt.md:51-70` - Updated agent spawning with new agents

**Key Changes Across All 3 Files:**
1. Auto MCP initialization (lines ~14-30): Checks Kit MCP availability, calls `open_repository` automatically
2. Fixed agent name (line ~59): `web-search-researcher` â†’ `external-doc-researcher`
3. Added new agents (lines ~55-59): `codebase-dependency-tracer` and `mcp-package-researcher`
4. Added CRITICAL links instruction (line ~60): External doc agents must return links
5. Added MCP auto-use note (line ~62): All codebase agents automatically use MCP when available

## Learnings

### 1. User Workflow Preferences

**Decision-Making Style:**
- User wants to make critical decisions but trusts implementation details
- Prefers clear options with recommendations and rationale
- Values "ultrathink" planning before execution
- Appreciates detailed analysis with concrete examples

**Key Decisions Made:**
1. **All 3 versions** - User has specific use cases for each variant (main, generic, nt)
2. **Auto-initialize MCP** - "must auto init if mcp is available" (not optional)
3. **Intelligent agent usage** - Agents decide when to use external docs, not "only if user asks"
4. **Links are critical** - External doc agents MUST return links (CRITICAL instruction added)

### 2. Command Architecture Patterns

**research_codebase.md** (209 lines):
- Most comprehensive version with CRITICAL documentarian constraints
- Includes thoughts/ directory integration
- Has detailed "what NOT to do" sections
- References Linear agents (to be created)

**research_codebase_generic.md** (175 lines):
- Simplified version without strict documentarian constraints
- No thoughts/ directory references
- Lighter weight for quick research

**research_codebase_nt.md** (186 lines):
- "No Thoughts" version for repos without thoughts/
- Has CRITICAL documentarian constraints like main version
- No thoughts-locator/thoughts-analyzer agents

**All versions share:**
- Same MCP initialization pattern
- Same agent spawning structure
- Same graceful degradation approach
- Consistent file reading and synthesis steps

### 3. Linear Agent References Kept Intentionally

**Current state:**
- `linear-ticket-reader` and `linear-searcher` referenced in 2 command files
- Agents don't exist yet in `.claude/agents/` directory
- User explicitly chose to keep references: "i will need to create linear agents"

**Next session context:**
- Must investigate humanlayer repo's Linear integration
- Linear MCP tools exist: `mcp__linear-server__*` (visible in system context)
- Goal: Create custom Linear agents adapted for this repo's workflow
- Challenge: Adapt humanlayer's approach to this repo's specific vision

### 4. hack/spec_metadata.sh Usage

**Script functionality:**
- Generates timestamp for filenames: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS`
- Extracts git metadata: commit hash, branch, repo name
- Includes thoughts status (via `humanlayer thoughts status`)
- Limits output to 40 lines to avoid noise

**Used by:**
- `research_codebase.md:81` - Calls script directly
- `research_codebase_generic.md:51` - Generates metadata with bash commands
- `research_codebase_nt.md:75` - Calls bash tools directly

**Inconsistency is intentional** - Each version has its own metadata generation approach, kept per user decision (Option A - keep current approach).

## Artifacts

**Files Created:**
- `hack/spec_metadata.sh:1-36` - Metadata generation script (acquired from humanlayer)
- `.mcp.example.json:1-16` - Team MCP configuration template
- `thoughts/shared/handoffs/general/2025-10-05_12-01-57_mcp-phase2-research-command-complete.md` - This handoff

**Files Modified:**
- `.claude/commands/research_codebase.md:1-209` - Main research command with MCP integration
- `.claude/commands/research_codebase_generic.md:1-175` - Generic variant with MCP integration
- `.claude/commands/research_codebase_nt.md:1-186` - No-thoughts variant with MCP integration

**Files Deleted:**
- `.mcp.json` - Moved to .mcp.example.json

**Git Commits:**
- `e42bda8` - feat: add hack/spec_metadata.sh and MCP example config
- `6bcf887` - feat: integrate MCP into /research_codebase command (Phase 2 Part 1)

## Action Items & Next Steps

### IMMEDIATE: Create Linear Agents (Next Session Primary Task)

**Step 1: Multi-Repository Setup**
```bash
# In new session, immediately open both repos
mcp__kit-dev__open_repository path_or_url="/home/selman/dev/hlyr-reveng"
mcp__kit-dev__open_repository path_or_url="/home/selman/dev/humanlayer"
```

**CRITICAL WARNING: Tree Command Will Fail**
- `get_file_tree` will error due to token overflow on humanlayer repo
- This is a KNOWN ISSUE that needs investigation
- Alternative approach: Use targeted file searches instead of full tree
- Possible solutions to investigate:
  1. Paginate tree results
  2. Filter by directory
  3. Use `ls` with specific paths instead
  4. Investigate token limits for tree command

**Step 2: Deep Investigation of Linear Agents in humanlayer**

Research questions:
1. Where are Linear agents defined? (likely `.claude/agents/`)
2. How do they use Linear MCP tools (`mcp__linear-server__*`)?
3. What workflows do they support?
4. How are they invoked from commands?
5. What patterns exist for ticket reading vs searching?

**Recommended investigation approach:**
```bash
# Use codebase-locator to find Linear-related files
Task: codebase-locator
Prompt: "Find all Linear agent definitions and Linear-related command files in humanlayer repo"

# Use codebase-analyzer to understand implementation
Task: codebase-analyzer
Prompt: "Analyze how Linear agents integrate with Linear MCP tools in humanlayer"

# Use codebase-pattern-finder to find usage examples
Task: codebase-pattern-finder
Prompt: "Find examples of Linear agent invocations from research_codebase and create_plan commands"
```

**Step 3: Adaptation Planning**

Key questions for user:
1. What Linear workflows are needed for this repo?
   - Ticket reading for context?
   - Ticket searching for related work?
   - Ticket creation/updates?
2. How should Linear agents integrate with existing commands?
3. What's different about this repo's needs vs humanlayer's?

**Step 4: Implementation**

Based on investigation and user decisions:
1. Create Linear agent definitions in `.claude/agents/`
2. Test agents work with Linear MCP tools
3. Verify graceful degradation if Linear MCP unavailable
4. Update documentation in CLAUDE.md if needed

### FUTURE: Continue Phase 2 (After Linear Agents)

**Phase 2 Part 2: /create_plan Command Integration**
- Reference: `thoughts/shared/handoffs/general/2025-10-04_17-06-19_mcp-integration-strategy.md:991-1026`
- Update research tasks to use MCP-enhanced agents
- Add mcp-package-researcher for external package integration
- Estimated time: 1-2 hours

**Phase 2 Part 3: /implement_plan Command Integration**
- Reference: `thoughts/shared/handoffs/general/2025-10-04_17-06-19_mcp-integration-strategy.md:1029-1057`
- Add optional `review_diff` pre-commit review step
- Estimated time: 30 minutes - 1 hour

## Other Notes

### Repository Context

**This repo (hlyr-reveng):**
- Purpose: Reverse engineering project with Claude Code MCP integration
- Phase 1: âœ… Complete (6 agents enhanced)
- Phase 2 Part 1: âœ… Complete (research_codebase command)
- Phase 2 Part 2-3: ðŸ“‹ Pending (create_plan, implement_plan commands)

**Parent repo (humanlayer):**
- Location: `../humanlayer/` (one directory up)
- Contains working Linear agent implementations
- Has established patterns for Linear MCP integration
- Will be source for Linear agent adaptation

### Available MCP Tools

**Kit MCP (codebase intelligence):**
- `open_repository` - Load repo context (CRITICAL: call this first)
- `get_file_tree` - **WARNING: Will error on large repos due to token overflow**
- `extract_symbols` - Works well, results cached
- `find_symbol_usages` - Returns dependency noise, filter needed
- `grep_code` - Reliable literal search
- Package tools: `deep_research_package`, `package_search_*`

**Ref MCP (documentation):**
- `ref_search_documentation` - Search curated docs
- `ref_read_url` - Read documentation URLs
- Occasional 502 errors observed, but generally reliable

**Linear MCP (tickets):**
- Full suite of Linear tools available: `mcp__linear-server__*`
- See system context for complete list
- Need to investigate best practices from humanlayer

### Known Issues to Investigate

1. **Tree Command Token Overflow:**
   - `get_file_tree` errors on large repos
   - Needs investigation for solution
   - May need pagination or filtering approach

2. **grep_ast Unreliability:**
   - Returns AST container nodes instead of actual code
   - Documented in: `thoughts/shared/handoffs/general/2025-10-04_19-59-39_mcp-tool-investigation-complete.md:88-98`
   - Use `grep_code` or `search_code` instead

3. **find_symbol_usages Noise:**
   - Returns matches from dependencies (node_modules, vendor, etc.)
   - Need to filter results to project files only
   - Documented in: `thoughts/shared/handoffs/general/2025-10-04_19-59-39_mcp-tool-investigation-complete.md:275-283`

### Session Workflow Success Pattern

**What worked well this session:**
1. **User ultrathink request** - Detailed planning with decision points before execution
2. **Clear decision framework** - Options with recommendations and rationale
3. **User makes critical calls** - User decided on all 5 key decisions
4. **Iterative refinement** - User corrected agent behavior in real-time ("agent must intelligent decide")
5. **Comprehensive commits** - 2 focused commits with detailed messages

**Replicate this pattern:**
- Always plan before executing
- Present options with clear recommendations
- Let user make strategic decisions
- Be ready to iterate based on feedback
- Document everything thoroughly

### Next Session Startup Commands

```bash
# Option 1: Resume from this handoff
/resume_handoff thoughts/shared/handoffs/general/2025-10-05_12-01-57_mcp-phase2-research-command-complete.md

# Option 2: Start fresh with context
# User will provide instructions for Linear agent creation
```

**First actions in next session:**
1. Open both repositories (hlyr-reveng + humanlayer)
2. Handle tree command error gracefully
3. Investigate Linear agents in humanlayer
4. Plan adaptation for this repo's needs
5. Get user approval before implementation
