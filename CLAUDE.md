# MCP Integration Guidelines

This project uses Kit MCP (codebase intelligence), Ref MCP (documentation research), and Linear MCP (ticket management) to enhance code analysis and development workflow.

## Tool Selection Decision Tree

### For Local Codebase Work

**Use Kit MCP when:**
- Finding symbol definitions → `extract_symbols`
- Understanding code structure → `get_file_tree`, `extract_symbols`
- Tracing symbol usage → `find_symbol_usages`
- Tracing dependencies manually → `extract_symbols` + `find_symbol_usages`
- Searching code patterns → `grep_code` (literal) or `search_code` (pattern)

**Use built-in tools when:**
- Reading specific files → `Read` (faster, complete content)
- Searching non-code files → `Grep` (configs, markdown, JSON)
- File path patterns → `Glob` (finding files by name)
- One-off searches → `Grep` (no caching benefit from Kit MCP)

**Note:** Kit MCP tools work best with Python and TypeScript. For other languages (Go, Rust, etc.), built-in tools may be more reliable.

### For External Documentation

**Use Ref MCP when:**
- Researching APIs → `ref_search_documentation`
- Reading documentation → `ref_read_url`
- Finding integration guides → `ref_search_documentation`
- Debugging third-party packages → `ref_search_documentation`

**Use WebSearch when:**
- Current events or news (post-January 2025)
- Real-time data
- General information (non-technical)
- Documentation not in Ref's curated index

**Use WebFetch when:**
- Reading specific URLs not available via Ref MCP
- Fetching content from blogs, tutorials, or non-official sources

### For Linear Ticket Management

**Use Linear MCP when:**
- Reading ticket details → `linear-ticket-reader` agent
- Searching for related tickets → `linear-searcher` agent
- Updating ticket status or comments → Via `/linear` command
- Getting ticket context for implementation → `linear-ticket-reader` agent

**Use `/linear` command directly when:**
- Creating tickets from thoughts documents
- Adding comments with conversation context
- Manually updating ticket fields
- Managing ticket workflow progression

## Repository Initialization

At the start of codebase work:
1. `open_repository` to load context (enables Kit MCP caching)
2. `get_file_tree` to understand structure (Git-aware, respects .gitignore)
3. `extract_symbols` for fast symbol overview (results are cached)
4. Then proceed with focused analysis using appropriate tools

**Important:** Repository IDs (e.g., `repo_0`) reset between Claude Code sessions. Re-initialize when starting a new session.

## Large Repository Handling

### Known Limitation: Subdirectory .gitignore Support

Kit-dev's `get_file_tree` currently only loads the root `.gitignore` file. Repositories with subdirectory `.gitignore` files (common in monorepos) may return excessive file counts.

**Symptoms:**
- Token overflow errors (>25k tokens)
- File count much higher than `git ls-files`
- Includes node_modules, venv, or other ignored directories

**Workaround**: Use targeted tools instead of full tree:

```bash
# Instead of get_file_tree:
Glob("**/*.py")           # Find Python files
Grep("pattern", type="ts") # Search TypeScript
LS specific/directory/     # List specific paths
```

**When to use get_file_tree**:
- Small repos (<1000 files)
- Repos with complete root .gitignore
- After verifying file count with: `git ls-files | wc -l`

**When to use alternatives**:
- Large repos (>5000 files)
- Monorepos with multiple node_modules
- Repos with subdirectory .gitignore files

**Fix Status**: Upstream fix in progress (see `thoughts/shared/plans/2025-10-05-SOL-1-kit-mcp-gitignore-fix.md`)

## Agent Usage

Commands will automatically use MCP-enhanced agents when available:

- **`codebase-locator`**: Locates files and components using Grep/Glob/LS + Kit MCP AST tools
  - Use when: Finding where features are implemented, locating specific code

- **`codebase-analyzer`**: Analyzes implementation details using Read + Kit MCP symbol/dependency tools
  - Use when: Understanding how something works, analyzing code structure

- **`codebase-pattern-finder`**: Finds similar implementations using Grep/Read + Kit MCP pattern tools
  - Use when: Looking for examples, finding existing patterns to follow

- **`external-doc-researcher`**: Researches external documentation using Ref MCP + WebSearch
  - Use when: Researching frameworks, APIs, best practices from official docs

- **`mcp-package-researcher`**: Deep package research using Ref MCP (docs) + Kit MCP package search (source)
  - Use when: Planning package integration, debugging third-party libraries, evaluating packages

- **`codebase-dependency-tracer`**: Maps dependency relationships through manual import tracing
  - Use when: Understanding module boundaries, tracing import chains
  - Note: Manual aggregation using extract_symbols + find_symbol_usages
  - For automated graphs: See thoughts/shared/research/dependency-analysis-options.md

- **`linear-ticket-reader`**: Reads Linear ticket details using Linear MCP
  - Use when: User mentions ticket ID, creating plans from tickets, understanding ticket context
  - Returns: Full ticket details including description, status, comments, links

- **`linear-searcher`**: Searches Linear tickets using Linear MCP
  - Use when: Finding similar issues, searching by status/label, historical context gathering
  - Returns: Organized ticket list grouped by status, priority, or date

## Graceful Degradation

All workflows work with or without MCP:
- **If MCP available:** Enhanced AST awareness, token efficiency, cached symbol extraction
- **If MCP unavailable:** Traditional Grep/Read/Glob tools work as fallback
- **No workflow changes:** Agents automatically choose best available tools

## Error Reporting and Unusual Behaviors

All agents include self-reporting mechanisms to provide visibility into tool usage and issues:

### Search Method Used (Mandatory)
Every agent output includes a "Search Method Used" section reporting:
- Which tools were actually used
- Why those tools were chosen
- Implicit indication of fallback decisions

### Unusual Behaviors Encountered (Optional)
Agents report unusual behaviors when they occur:

**Reported conditions:**
- MCP tool failures (connection errors, timeouts)
- Empty results when data was expected
- Fallback from primary tool to degraded functionality
- Performance issues (slow responses, timeouts)
- Data inconsistencies or validation failures

**Report format:**
- **Tool**: Which tool encountered the issue
- **Issue**: What went wrong
- **Resolution**: What fallback or alternative was used
- **Impact**: Agent-determined assessment (Minimal/Moderate/Severe)

**When main agents encounter unusual behavior reports:**
- Minimal impact: Noted in synthesis, no action needed
- Moderate/Severe impact: Warning indicator (⚠️) + suggestion to create Linear ticket for investigation

**Example from agent output:**
```markdown
### Unusual Behaviors Encountered

**Tool**: `mcp__kit-dev__grep_ast`
**Issue**: Repository not initialized - repo_id was null
**Resolution**: Fell back to traditional Grep tool
**Impact**: Minimal - Results less precise but all relevant files found
```

This text-based self-reporting requires no parsing infrastructure - main agents read and comprehend these sections naturally through LLM capabilities.

## Best Practices

1. **Incremental Symbol Extraction:** `extract_symbols` results are cached—use it liberally
2. **Context Before Analysis:** Use `get_file_tree` and `extract_symbols` before diving deep
3. **Research Dependencies:** Use `deep_research_package` before integrating new packages
4. **Verify Findings:** Kit MCP tools may return large result sets—always review and filter
5. **Language Support:** Kit MCP works best with Python/TypeScript; use built-in tools for other languages

## Thoughts Architecture

This repository uses a **Git Submodule** for the thoughts system.

**Structure:**
- `thoughts/` - Git Submodule pointing to https://github.com/Ferymad/hlyr-reveng-thoughts
- Thoughts have independent version control and commit history
- Main repository only tracks submodule reference (commit hash)

**Benefits:**
- Clean main repository history (thoughts don't clutter commits)
- Better organization and scalability
- No symlinks - full compatibility with Claude Code file tools
- Independent thoughts versioning

**Workflow:**

When creating/updating thoughts documents:
```bash
# Work in thoughts submodule
cd thoughts/
git add shared/research/my-research.md
git commit -m "Add research on topic X"
git push

# Update main repo submodule reference (optional)
cd ..
git add thoughts
git commit -m "Update thoughts reference"
git push
```

When pulling latest thoughts:
```bash
git submodule update --remote thoughts
```

**First-time clone:**
```bash
git clone <repository>
git submodule update --init
```

**Note:** No `humanlayer thoughts sync` commands needed. Thoughts are immediately available after writing to files.

Remember: Better context = Better code suggestions
